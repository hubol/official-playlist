                <p>My mother used to listen to this song a lot when I was young.</p>
                <p>I love the plucky guitar in the bridge.</p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWEc7hcTPoE">American Life - Madonna</a>
                <p>My family used to listen to this album a lot in the car. I remember us all singing along while driving to visit my grandmother.</p>
                <p>I remember my mother really enjoying the <q>fuck it</q> and the goofy-ass rap verse in this song.</p>
                <p>The production on this album is pretty interesting.</p>

                <a href="samples/countryp.mp3">countryp.mid - Unknown</a>
                <p>A charming piece of MIDI music heard in the desert town in <i>Oddwarg Animal RPG</i>.</p>
                <p>The music begins playing as soon as the text <q>A great evil has entered the world.</q> appears on screen.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Oddwarg Animal RPG</i> is the first Game Maker game that really captivated me.
                    I was using my father's laptop while visiting my grandmother in Florida in 2006 when I discovered it on the now-defunct Game Maker Games website.
                    My parents didn't purchase games very often for us, so this lengthy, free platform adventure provided a lot of entertainment for my little brother and I.
                    Eventually, I decided I wanted to learn to make games and reached out to Oddwarg via e-mail, asking how he created the name entry field.
                    I wondered if he had to program every possible letter combination, including the one for my unusual name.
                </p>
                <p>Needless to say, I can't help but feel nostalgic listening to the music.</p>

                <a href="samples/mutual-blue.m4a">Mutual Blue - the Oddwarg</a>
                <p>
                    I stayed in touch with Oddwarg via e-mail for a couple years after our first contact.
                    I would usually ask questions about how to execute a particular task in Game Maker and within a week or so he would respond with Game Maker source code that I could play with.
                    Eventually, he stopped responding. I thought I had irritated him, but it turned out that he had to perform mandatory military service.
                    During his absence, I sent him copies of my latest games including <i>BEN!!</i>, a game about a ball with a face, and <i>CRAZ'D!</i>, a game about exploring a large world as an insane asylum escapee.
                    When he returned, he said he enjoyed <i>CRAZ'D!</i>, which I was flattered by, and that soon he would be releasing his game <i>Madness</i>.
                    He offered to have me playtest it. Of course, I accepted.
                </p>
                <p>This is the title screen music from <i>Madness</i>. It is quite nice.</p>

                <a href="samples/bombastic-yellow-sheep.m4a">Bombastic Yellow Sheep - the Oddwarg</a>
                <p>The overworld area of <i>Madness</i> features 8 different music tracks that become available based on the player's progress and system time.</p>
                <p>This song plays during the daytime after the player has defeated a substantial number of wizards.</p>
                <p>The title and melody are quite playful.</p>

                <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/timelapse-kingdom">Timelapse Kingdom - C418</a>
                <p>I really enjoyed the music in <i>Minecraft</i> and soon became interested in the rest of the composer's music.</p>
                <p>This album features very long songs, which was apparently a design goal. There is a lot of simple building and layering going on.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, I don't really listen to this music. But it was important for me at one point.</p>
                <p>I remember getting in trouble for defiantly listening to this in my headphones during the school news.</p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/total-drag">total drag - C418</a>
                <p>This was another favorite of mine. The instruments are very innocent and pleasant. I am transported to riding the school bus in winter.</p>
                <p>The album explores a few motifs, and I was inspired to incorporate motifs in the soundtracks for my game <i>2</i>.</p>
                <p>The cover design inspired the color palette for my games <i>JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>121</i>.</p>
                <p>I also recorded a cover of this song which is heard at the end of <i>JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS</i>.</p>

                <a href="https://gutswav.bandcamp.com/track/the-things-we-saw-feat-beastpile">The Things We Saw - GUTS.WAV</a>
                <p>Music by my friend Matthew. I would love to perform with him sometime.</p>
                <p>I used to listen to this album while folding my family's clothes.</p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thevoiceofageneration/my-way-clusterfucked">My Way Clusterfucked - Rasmus Hungnes</a>
                <p>Oddwarg's brother created this "remix" of <i>My Way</i> performed by Frank Sinatra. Me being me, I had never heard the original before this.</p>
                <p>The arrogance of the lyrics and vocal delivery combined with the "clusterfuck" effect is quite excellent.</p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XoSGlGOxwE">Benny (the Bouncing Bump) - The Residents</a>
                <p>Oddwarg introduced me to The Residents around 2012. When I first heard this song, I was offended to hear general MIDI instruments outside of the context of a video game.</p>
                <p>But now I love it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKTDWNr7YdY">Just For You - The Residents</a>
                <p>This was the first song on the first CD I ever purchased. It is an amusing reinterpretation of The Residents' cover of <i>We Are The World</i>.</p>
                <p>This seemingly abridged recording omits a verse:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    I am a fake!<br>
                    I am a rip-off!<br>
                    I will definitely<br>
                    Shit on you to get off!
                </blockquote>
                <p>I enjoy the singing character's arrogance and misery. The mispronunciation of the word "sycophant" appears in every recording.</p>
                <p>Of particular note is the backup singer's smooth, sine tone-like voice.</p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeCTWlwGXHg">Banana Fanna - Charles Bobuck</a>
                <p>When The Residents revealed themselves as the electronic-metal trio "Randy, Chuck, and Bob" after nearly 40 years, it enabled Charles Bobuck, their composer, to release music under his own name.</p>
                <p>The title of the song comes from <i>The Name Game</i>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Chuck, Chuck, Bo-buck<br>
                    Banana, Fanna, Fo-fuck
                </blockquote>
                <p>This reissued version of the album prefers tuned percussion over discordant thumps and crashes in a handful of tracks.</p>
                <p>This was the first song on the second CD I ever purchased. I listened to it several mornings while working the opening shift at the local Domino's Pizza where I was manager.</p>

                <a href="https://sjroberts.bandcamp.com/track/the-boat-song">The Boat Song - Sun Stains</a>
                <blockquote>
                    I started choking<br>
                    You took to smoking
                </blockquote>
                <p>Sometimes I listen to this while doing dishes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="samples/fatboy.mp3">Fat Boy - Sun Stains</a>
                <p>This is a song from 2013-ish by my old friend who I knew as "Tipp". Nowadays he records under the name "John King Cave".</p>
                <p>The mumbled vocals and bubblegum synths are very lovely.</p>
                <p>I would love to one day perform this song.</p>
